                Stable attention and powerful mindfulness have the ability to
                permanently change your life for the better. However, 99% of the
                benefits come from consistent practice, not from intellectual
                understanding. Your goal for this stage is to develop a habit of
                meditating. Do not worry about the quality of meditation yet -
                what matters is the fact that you are making meditation a part
                of your life.

                Distraction can be classified into two distinct steps:
                forgetting and mind wandering. Forgetting is the moment when the
                meditation object disappears from both attention and awareness.
                Mind wandering is the spontaneous movement of attention between
                loosely related thoughts after forgetting occurs. Your only goal
                for this stage is to work with mind wandering through persistant
                effort and positive reinforcement.
            </p>
            <p style={pStyle}>
                As stated in the Overview page, the sustaining of attention is
                involuntary. No matter how hard you try, distractions will
                always arise and will eventually take the attention away from
                the breathe. A smarter way of stabilizing the attention is
                strengthening the peripheral awareness to help you catch
                distractions when they are present. Bringing the attention back
                to the breathe does exactly this.
            </p>
            <p style={pStyle}>
                All you need to do in this stage is holding a strong intention
                to appreciate the moment when you realize that you've been
                distracted and diligently bringing the attention back to the
                breathe - no matter how bad you seem at the task. Finding the
                'aha!' moment joyful is critical. Appreciation and joy brings
                calmness, and calmness paves the way for the peripheral
                awareness to develop.

                Distraction can be classified into two distinct steps:
                forgetting and mind wandering. Forgetting is the moment when the
                meditation object disappears from both attention and awareness.
                Mind wandering is the spontaneous movement of attention between
                loosely related thoughts after forgetting occurs. Your only goal
                for this stage is to work with forgetting through strengthening
                introspective attention and focusing on the sensation of breath.
            </p>
            <p style={pStyle}>
                When you began, frequent mind wandering made it hard for you to
                remember what exact distraction destabilized your attention. Now
                that mind wandering has subsided significantly, you can begin to
                familiarize yourself with ideas that cause you to forget the
                breath and detect them as they start to arise. This prevents the
                attention from being carried away by distractions and losing the
                breath. For Stage 3, the method of detection is occasional
                moments of introspective attention.
            </p>
            <p style={pStyle}>
                Another aspect of this stage is redirection of attention from
                breath related thoughts to breath related sensations. You may
                have noticed that the idea of breathing and the sensation of
                breath are different mental objects. Our attention is usually
                placed on ideas and thoughts in daily life. Giving attention
                primarily to the sensations quiets the thought related brain
                network and therefore reduces arising distractions.
