            <h3 style={h3Style}>What is meditation?</h3>
            <p style={pStyle}>
                Meditation is a practice that helps one see every moment of
                his/her life as clearly as possible. At first, the practice
                stabilizes the attention by restricting its movement to the
                object of meditation - in our case, the breath. Then, the
                practice enhances the awareness through introspective and
                extrospective exercises.
            </p>

            <h3 style={h3Style}>Why should I meditate?</h3>
            <p style={pStyle}>
                Meditation has a reputation of being a relaxation activity.
                However, when done consistently, meditation's impact is far more
                broad and significant than the temporary relaxation it may
                provide. Meditation's long term benefits can be classified into
                2 categories: subjective (changes in subjective experience) and
                objective (changes everyone can observe).
            </p>
            <SimpleDiv>
                <h5>Subjective</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clarity: View every moment clearly and without bias</li>
                    <li>
                        Equanimity: Savour each passing second and retain
                        calmness during stressful moments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compassion: Be wholly connected with everyone, from your
                        friends to your boss
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Objective</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Improved Performance: Stable attention and resistance to
                        disappointment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improved Relationships: Less affected by emotions and
                        narratives of your mind
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Moral Conducts: Ethical actions flow naturally without
                        internal resistance
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </SimpleDiv>
            <p style={pStyle}>
                Of course, the changes only come with persistant and skillful
                practice. You may be doubtful of the claims made in this page.
                That's quite understandable, since I also felt that way when I
                first considered meditating. Therefore, the site has a few links
                containing scientific evidences at the bottom of this page.

                    <h5>Attention</h5>

                            Definition: The selective focusing on specific

                        <li>
                            Example: You are walking outside thinking about food
                            when a beautiful butterfly appears in front of your
                            eyes. Your attention just shifted from the thought
                            about food to the butterfly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Peripheral Awareness</h5>
                    <ul style={{ margin: 0 }}>

                            when a beautiful butterfly appears in front of your
                            eyes. Though your attention is focused on the
                            butterfly, the visual information of the road you
                            are walking on is present in your peripheral
                            awareness.

                <h5>Intention: The Essence of Meditation</h5>
                <p style={pStyle}>
                    Intention is what gives meditation the power to enhance
                    attention and peripheral awareness. Regardless of how
                    distracted a practitioner may be during meditation,
                    harbouring the right intention throughout the course of the
                    practice will guarantee spiritual progress. This is because
                    intention, when held for long, inevitably results in mental
                    action which soon becomes a habit.
                </p>
                <SimplerDiv>
                    <h5 style={{ color: 'teal', textAlign: 'center' }}>
                        Intention => Mental Action => Habit

                </SimplerDiv>
                <p style={pStyle}>
                    Therefore, no matter how bad your mind may seem at
                    concentrating, simply doing your best to hold the right
                    intention during meditation eventually leads to progress.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>Positive Reinforcement vs Self Criticism</h5>
                <p style={pStyle}>
                    One of the most significant hindrances to meditation
                    progress is our habitual tendency to scold ourselves when
                    our expectations are not met. Almost all beginners get
                    frustrated at how terrible they are at maintaining attention
                    to their breaths. This reaction is both counterproductive to
                    progress and illogical - as mentioned by
                    <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_shift#Voluntary_vs._automatic_shifts_in_attention"
                        target="_blank"
                    >
                        &nbsp;this article
                    </a>
                    , sustaining attention is entirely involuntary. However, the
                    good news is the fact that directing attention can be done
                    voluntarily.
                </p>
                <p style={pStyle}>
                    This fact combined with the previous paragraph on intention
                    leads to the conclusion that meditation should be motivated
                    based on positive reinforcement rather than self criticism.
                    Fully appreciating the fact that you've remembered your
                    intention upon realizing that you've been daydreaming is the
                    best path to stabilizing your attention. Only by finding
                    meditation enjoyable, you will dedicate yourself to the
                    practice long term. The improvements in attention and
                    awareness will naturally follow.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h5>
                    Intellectual Understanding vs Experiential Understanding
                </h5>
                <p style={pStyle}>
                    This is a classic pitfall that many practitioners fall into
                    once they learn about meditation's potentials. The positive
                    changes come only with practice. Expecting equanimity while
                    only talking about meditation theory is akin to expecting
                    yourself to have a fantastic body while only talking about
                    different exercises.
                </p>

                <h5>Integration of Mindfulness to Everyday Life</h5>
                <p style={pStyle}>
                    Lastly, though developing stable attention and mindfulness
                    during meditation is important, it is equally important to
                    try your best to make stable attention and mindfulness a
                    part of your life. Throughout your day, remember to be as
                    focused as you can on whatever you are doing. Try to always
                    be in the present and be aware of your thoughts. Please feel
